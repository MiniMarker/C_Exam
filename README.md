# C_Exam 2018

## Description
This is a project for decrypting encrypted password by reversing the deprecated MD5-encryption method.

### Flow of the program
1. The given hash is validated in some simple checks.
2. The given hash is splitted into two parts and saved in a struct called SplittedPassword.
3. Searches all lines in the dictionary file.
    1. Every line gets encrypted with the salt of the given hash.
    2. If there is a match the result is displayed to the user and the program is terminated.
4. Bruteforce beginning to guess password.
    1. Every guess gets encrypted with the salt of the given hash.
    2.  If there is a match the result is displayed to the user and the program is terminated.

## How to run
1. Clone this repo
2. From root folder in the project, run the following commands:
    - `make`
    - `./bin/dictionary '<hash>'` 
        - ex)  `./bin/dictionary '$1$JpWPMkg+$WpRBP/wtLDqu83m.wo16D0'`

### Aditional make commands
- `make clean`
  - cleans up autogenerated files
- `make remake`
  - cleans up autogenerated files and builds the program

## Missing features
When I started on this project I implemented the feature that it would be possible to scan through a file of hashes and
return all the decrypted results, the function is still in the code but commented out and made not reachable because
in bruteforce the program exites completely without closing the file if there is a guess.

I made this desition to completely exit by using `exit(0)` the program if the password needed to be bruteforced and 
disable this function because lack of time and because it wasnÂ´t a formal requirement in the exam to have this feature implemented.
