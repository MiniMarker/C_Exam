# Future ideas

1. Multithreading
2. Finishing up the bruteforce to work with a document scan of given hashes
3. Multiple dictionary files
4. Combining the words in the dictionary file
5. Docker and deployment:
    1. Package the program in a Docker container
    2. Deploy it on a server
    3. Open up a port
    4. From the client: send a hash to the exposed port on the server
    5. Let the server calculate the result and return it.
